  abstract = {Automatic facial expression analysis is an interesting and challenging
	problem, and impacts important applications in many areas such as
	human–computer interaction and data-driven animation. Deriving an
	effective facial representation from original face images is a vital
	step for successful facial expression recognition. In this paper,
	we empirically evaluate facial representation based on statistical
	local features, Local Binary Patterns, for person-independent facial
	expression recognition. Different machine learning methods are systematically
	examined on several databases. Extensive experiments illustrate that
	\{LBP\} features are effective and efficient for facial expression
	recognition. We further formulate Boosted-LBP to extract the most
	discriminant \{LBP\} features, and the best recognition performance
	is obtained by using Support Vector Machine classifiers with Boosted-LBP
	features. Moreover, we investigate \{LBP\} features for low-resolution
	facial expression recognition, which is a critical problem but seldom
	addressed in the existing work. We observe in our experiments that
	\{LBP\} features perform stably and robustly over a useful range
	of low resolutions of face images, and yield promising performance
	in compressed low-resolution video sequences captured in real-world
	environments. },
