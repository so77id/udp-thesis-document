  Abstract                 = {Facial expression’s machine analysis is one of the most challenging problems in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI). Naturally, facial expressions depend on subtle movements of facial muscles to show emotional states. After having studied the relations between basic expressions and corresponding facial deformation models, we propose two new textons, \{VTB\} and moments on spatiotemporal plane, to describe the transformation of human face during facial expressions. These descriptors aim at catching both general shape changes and motion texture details. Therefore, modeling the temporal behavior of facial expression captures the dynamic deformation of facial components. Finally, \{SVM\} based system is used to efficiently recognize the expression for a single image in sequence. Then, the probabilities of all the frames are used to predict the class of the current sequence. The experimental results are evaluated on both Cohan–Kanade and \{MMI\} databases. By comparison to other methods, the effectiveness of our method is clearly demonstrated.},

  Abstract                 = {In the last decade, the research topic of automatic analysis of facial expressions has become a central topic in machine vision research. Nonetheless, there is a glaring lack of a comprehensive, readily accessible reference set of face images that could be used as a basis for benchmarks for efforts in the field. This lack of easily accessible, suitable, common testing resource forms the major impediment to comparing and extending the issues concerned with automatic facial expression analysis. In this paper, we discuss a number of issues that make the problem of creating a benchmark facial expression database difficult. We then present the MMI facial expression database, which includes more than 1500 samples of both static images and image sequences of faces in frontal and in profile view displaying various expressions of emotion, single and multiple facial muscle activation. It has been built as a Web-based direct-manipulation application, allowing easy access and easy search of the available images. This database represents the most comprehensive reference set of images for studies on facial expression analysis to date.},

  Abstract                 = {Automatic facial expression analysis is an interesting and challenging problem, and impacts important applications in many areas such as human–computer interaction and data-driven animation. Deriving an effective facial representation from original face images is a vital step for successful facial expression recognition. In this paper, we empirically evaluate facial representation based on statistical local features, Local Binary Patterns, for person-independent facial expression recognition. Different machine learning methods are systematically examined on several databases. Extensive experiments illustrate that \{LBP\} features are effective and efficient for facial expression recognition. We further formulate Boosted-LBP to extract the most discriminant \{LBP\} features, and the best recognition performance is obtained by using Support Vector Machine classifiers with Boosted-LBP features. Moreover, we investigate \{LBP\} features for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which is a critical problem but seldom addressed in the existing work. We observe in our experiments that \{LBP\} features perform stably and robustly over a useful range of low resolutions of face images, and yield promising performance in compressed low-resolution video sequences captured in real-world environments. },
